# Hanno Ops Playbooks: 2014-2019

In Hanno's past, we [published](https://hanno.co/journal/defaulting-to-transparency/) and maintained this series of _Playbooks_ detailing how we operated as a distributed team.

They played a central role in documenting what, at the time, was considered an unconventional way of working, and were widely shared, both within the design community and across other industries.

In November 2020, we decided to archive these Playbooks from the Hanno website and preserve their contents in this GitHub repository as a snapshot in time, as they were less relevant to our [new focus on healthcare](https://hanno.co/journal/focus-health-sustainability/).

We've since published a **[brand new digital health Playbook](https://playbook.hanno.co)** which is more reflective of how we operate nowadays.
